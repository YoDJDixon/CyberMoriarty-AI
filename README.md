# 🕵️ CyberMoriarty – AI Offensive Security Framework (Prototype)

**CyberMoriarty** is a research-driven prototype for an **AI-assisted offensive security framework**.  
The vision is to build an **AI-powered Metasploit alternative** that can assist red teamers and penetration testers by:  

- Automating reconnaissance  
- Suggesting exploit strategies from vulnerability databases  
- Recommending ethical actions before execution  
- Supporting compliance & supervisor approval workflows  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
This project is currently a **prototype/replica**.  
Most features (UI, dashboards, and workflows) are **mockups** and **not fully functional yet**.  
The intent of this project is purely **educational and ethical**: designed for **red team research, penetration testing, and cybersecurity learning**.  
The author does **NOT endorse illegal use** of this tool.

## ✨ Vision & Goals
CyberMoriarty aims to become:  
- ✅ An **AI assistant** that helps security professionals make faster, ethical decisions  
- ✅ An **AI-driven exploitation planner** using vulnerability databases  
- ✅ A **responsible AI-offensive framework** with built-in guardrails for legality & compliance

## 🚧 Current Status
- [x] Dashboard UI (prototype / mockup)  
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning integration  
- [ ] Exploit planning engine  
- [ ] AI-driven recommendations (POC stage)  
- [ ] Supervisor approval workflows  

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate real vulnerability scanning (e.g. Nmap, OpenVAS APIs)  
- [ ] Exploit recommendation system (CVEs + exploit-db mapping)  
- [ ] AI decision engine for ethical gating  
- [ ] Reporting & compliance exports (PDF/CSV)  
- [ ] Open-source contributions & plugin support

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- UI: Electron + TailwindCSS (prototype stage)  
- Backend: Node.js / Python (depending on module)  
- AI Planning: Future integration with LLMs

## 📂 How to Run (Prototype)
Since this is an early prototype, many features are placeholders.  
To explore the UI locally:  

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CyberMoriarty.git
cd CyberMoriarty

# Install dependencies (if Node.js project)
npm install

# Run prototype
npm start
